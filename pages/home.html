  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    LeapcapJS is simple a concept of what the future could look like in terms of online healthcare. Healthcare is something that is becoming more and more prevalent in today's society due to our massive world population, and the lack of resources to tend for everyone. Technology is playing a large role in alleviating this issue by connecting more patients with more doctors, and by creating more efficient ways of collecting data. LeapcapJS is a practical example of a new way to collect data and connect patients. I live in the Silicon Valley, where every other person has a job involving intensive use of a keyboard. Some of the complications that can arise as a result of heavy keyboard use include carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis. Injuries such as these are usually very preventable at their first signs, which is where LeapcapJS will come in. An application such as this allows a person to see their hand in real time 3D rendering, on the web, and record its motions. These motions are stored in very small JSON objects so that they can be re-created, or played back on another computer. Following are some practical applications for this.

    <h3 class="panel-title">What can LeapcapJS be used for?</h3>

  <div class="panel-body">
    The ability to efficiently record the motions of a human hand on the web, in 3D is certainly a very powerful ability, but how can it be used to prevent injuries?
    <ul>
    	<li>Doctor-Patient Interaction in which a doctor or therapist will be able to review the movements of the patients' hand and warn them of streneous use. A doctor will be able to interact with a 3D hand without the patient even being in their office. This will allow rapid feedback, and more cooperative patients. With this rapid feedback, patients will be less prone to injuries.</li>
    	<li>Interactive activities to excercise the hand! The main reason why people get carpal tunnel syndrome is because of repeated motions. If an office or factory worker excercises his or her hand by moving it in different ways, and stretches, they will be less prone to injury. Since LeapcapJS uses a popular WebGL based library, <a href="http://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a>, content creators will quickly be able to create activities and games that involve moving the hand in unique ways.
